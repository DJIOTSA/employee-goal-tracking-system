        EMPLOYEE GOAL TRACKER SOFTWARE SYSTEM 

I- IDEA
    we want to follow the structure of whatsapp so that we can can create enterprise with the function of a group.
    This will allow the super admin(the creator of the enterprise) to register employee to the enterprise, create and assigns them goals and activities (are segmented part of a goal).

    The admin will also granted registered enterprise's employees to admin. An Admin have the authorization to add activities, but not goals, to validate employees report, can only change it's actions

    only an user of an enterprise can view perform an action under that enterprise.

    all requested informations will succeed if and only if the user have the authorization

    the data form validation will first be implemented at the level of the the front-end. and will be also be controlled at the level of the back-end but this additional measure of security will be used to test and updating phase of the software life circle.

    specific functions will be apply only to dg and pdg of enterprises.
