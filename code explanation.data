EVERY CAPITAL ACTION DONE BY AN EMPLOYEE ADMIN IS ADDED SENT TO THE ADMINISTRATOR
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Queryset Filtering: The users queryset is filtered efficiently using exclude to exclude users already in instance.goal.users_in_charge, avoiding redundant list comprehension and in checks.

Bulk Addition: The users_in_charge.add(*users) method leverages bulk addition for multiple users at once, improving efficiency.

Early Exit: The if users condition prevents unnecessary database operations if there are no new users to add.

Conciseness: The code is more concise and readable due to the direct queryset filtering and removal of redundant list comprehension.

COMPLETION BONUS AND TARGET STATUS

CRITERIA ON WHAT WE ARE GOING TO ASSIGN A BONUS COMPLETION TO A USER:
1- The user must be the one responsible for the completion of the target
2- The target report must be submit between the given time
3- The target report rate must be amount [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
4- The target completion bonus status must not be ACCEPTED, PENDING OR PAID

CONDITION TO REJECT A TARGET COMPLETION
1- The user is not responsible for of the target
2- The target report is submit after the dateline [when ever this is verified the completion bonus is rejected]
3- The target report rate must be 0 or Null [ if condition 2 is false and 3 is true]

IMPLEMENTATION CRITERIA

The double verification will be made: at the level of the target and the report to ensure that the completion bonus is assigned
to a user that have the merit to be rewarded

Factors at the level of the target: 
- is_done: to check wether the target report is submit or not and also to check the target completion status
  (Then the use of a boolean is not enough, here we are going to use an integer flag with two value: SUBMIT AND COMPLETED)
- status: to check the completion bonus status:  REJECTED, ACCEPTED, PAID, PENDING

    For activities with multiple users:
    - submit_employees: to check if the users have submit their reports
    - sold_to: to check completion bonus status for PAID
    (The remaining completion bonus status [REJECTED, ACCEPTED, PENDING] will be set at the level of the report)


Factors at the level of the target report
- submit_late: to check if the target was done during the required time
- The rate: to evaluate the report and check if the target completion.
  (A target is_done status will set as completed if and only if the rate is different than 0 and None )
- status: To check if the completion bonus


REPORT RATE REVIEW AND COMPLETION BONUS MANAGEMENT

CONDITIONS TO DEDUCT THE COMPLETION BONUS FROM THE USER COMPLETION BONUS ACCOUNT
1- The user must have been credited or paid the amount of the target completion bonus (The target completion bonus can't be changed if at least one responsible of the target initiate a payment on that target)
2- The updated rate must be 0 but the submit_late status will remain false (Since the error is coming from the administration)
3- And the administrator can decide to mark the target as not done if there is a necessity

MODULES THAT WILL BE AFFECTED
- PAYROLL 
- TASKS 
- PERFORMANCE

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
REPORT REPEAT FUNCTIONALITY

For goals and activities with single user 
- REPEAT to specify how come the target is going to be repeated: DAILY, WEEKLY, AND MONTHLY


Factors of verification at the level of the target
-repeat : specify the period of repetition and the repetition status [no for non-repeat task](
    if the repeat period is change then the repeat_number will be initialize to 1 and you can only trace the previous
    target using the previous report date of submission of the repeat and repeat_num fields of the report)
    
-repeat_number: specify the current repetition repeat_number: 


Factors a t the level of the level of the report
-repeat_num: store the target repetition number (note that if the user have missed a target repeat, repeat_number will be set to the 
  missed target repeat number so far as the repeat period is the same)
